# Learn-Terraform

Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial you will need:

The Terraform CLI (1.2.0+) installed.
The AWS CLI installed or Role on IAM that has Admin full access for EC2.
AWS account and associated credentials that allow you to create resources.

Terraform Block
The terraform {} block contains Terraform settings, including the required providers Terraform will use to provision your infrastructure. For each provider, the source attribute defines an optional hostname, a namespace, and the provider type. Terraform installs providers from the Terraform Registry by default. In this example configuration, the aws provider's source is defined as hashicorp/aws, which is shorthand for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws.

You can also set a version constraint for each provider defined in the required_providers block. The version attribute is optional, but we recommend using it to constrain the provider version so that Terraform does not install a version of the provider that does not work with your configuration. If you do not specify a provider version, Terraform will automatically download the most recent version during initialization.

To learn more, reference the provider source documentation.

»Providers
The provider block configures the specified provider, in this case aws. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to create and manage your resources.

You can use multiple provider blocks in your Terraform configuration to manage resources from different providers. You can even use different providers together. For example, you could pass the IP address of your AWS EC2 instance to a monitoring resource from DataDog.

»Resources
Use resource blocks to define components of your infrastructure. A resource might be a physical or virtual component such as an EC2 instance, or it can be a logical resource such as a Heroku application.

Resource blocks have two strings before the block: the resource type and the resource name. In this example, the resource type is aws_instance and the name is app_server. The prefix of the type maps to the name of the provider. In the example configuration, Terraform manages the aws_instance resource with the aws provider. Together, the resource type and resource name form a unique ID for the resource. For example, the ID for your EC2 instance is aws_instance.app_server.

Resource blocks contain arguments which you use to configure the resource. Arguments can include things like machine sizes, disk image names, or VPC IDs. Our providers reference lists the required and optional arguments for each resource. For your EC2 instance, the example configuration sets the AMI ID to an Ubuntu image, and the instance type to t2.micro, which qualifies for AWS' free tier. It also sets a tag to give the instance a name.

»Initialize the directory
When you create a new configuration — or check out an existing configuration from version control — you need to initialize the directory with terraform init.

Initializing a configuration directory downloads and installs the providers defined in the configuration, which in this case is the aws provider.

Initialize the directory.
